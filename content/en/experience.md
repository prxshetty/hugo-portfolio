My career has been a passion for pushing boundaries and delivering solutions in Machine Learning, AI, and Software Development.

Most recently, during a research co-op, I analyzed reasoning and non-reasoning LLMs on proprietary financial data that gained recognition across the industry—cited by The Wall Street Journal, Barron’s, CNBC, and The Financial Times.

I’m open to full-time roles and collaborations. If you have a project or idea that aligns with my skills and experience, I’d love to connect.
