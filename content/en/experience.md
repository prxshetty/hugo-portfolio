My career path has been defined by a passion for pushing technological boundaries and delivering impactful solutions in Machine Learning, AI, and Software Development.

As you'll discover, each role in my journey has been more than just a position—it's been an opportunity to solve complex problems and drive meaningful technological advancements. From developing sophisticated financial prediction models at Marva.ai to engineering efficient ML pipelines at Knowledge Solutions India, and pioneering digital marketing strategies at Laugh Out Loud Ventures, each experience has built upon the last.

Most recently, during a research co-op, I analyzed reasoning and non-reasoning LLMs on proprietary financial data, producing insights that gained recognition across the industry—cited by The Wall Street Journal, Barron’s, CNBC, and The Financial Times.

I’m currently open to full-time roles and collaborations. If you have a project or idea that aligns with my skills and experience, I’d love to connect.
